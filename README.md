Problem Statement: Create a bar chart and histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of age or gender in a population. 

The dataset used is attached to the repository as well.

Used libraries:
-Pandas for analyzing, cleaning, exploring and manipulating the dataset. (Common library when working with datasets)
-Numpy for working with array. (Datasets using programs have NumPy use)
-Matplotlib for creating visualizations like plots.
-Matplotlib.pyplot for using matplotlib to work like MATLAB. (To put it in simple words it's like a GUI interface where you can easily give precisions for your plot)
-seaborn for making statistical graphs like histograms and Bargraphs.
